I've been using sublime text for the entire time that I've been programming, and I will continue to do so, but I think it's good to know a little bit about vim if you're going to do a lot of programming.

I found [this awesome cheatsheet](http://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/cheatsheetvi.php) on Ryan's Tutorials, which is a really cool resource that I've never seen untill now, with really good tutorials about linux, bash scripting, and a bunch of other programming stuff.

[Fullstack Python](http://www.fullstackpython.com/vim.html) also has a really good list of resources

I've also been googling around a bit to figure out all of the functionality I might need to get up and running with vim.

Here's a couple of of the most useful commands for reference:
* :w - saves the file
* :x - save and quit
* :q! - exit and undo any changes made
* :set nu - display line numbers
* :syntax on - turn on syntax highlighting
* vi .vimrc - open up the vim configuration file
* v to select characters, d to cut, y to yank/copy, p to paste
* /pattern - search for a pattern
* n find next occurance of pattern
* :%s/pattern/replace/g - find and replace every occurance
* {} - back and form one paragraph
* () - back and forth one sentence
