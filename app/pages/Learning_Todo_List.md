title: Todo List and Reviews for Programming and Data Science Courses and Books
date: 2016-03-12 16:30:16

I figure, in lieu of a transcript for all of my independent computer science and data science studies, I would keep a running wish list and list of reviews for books/courses that I would like to read and have already read.  

##  Books/Courses I would like to complete

* [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) - I'm still not sure why I'm reading this book, and I'm on page 87 of about 800, but I'm told it's the best computer science book ever written.  The first hundred pages were pretty basic, though I did learn the difference between recursion and iteration, and now I'm starting to get into functional programming, which should be pretty cool.

* [Social Media Mining - Zafarani, Ali Abbasi, Liu](http://dmml.asu.edu/smm/SMM.pdf) - The future.

* [ThinkDSP - Allen Downey](http://greenteapress.com/thinkdsp/) - Introduction to Digital Signal Processing from one of my favorite technical writers.

* [Natural Language Processing with Python - Bird, Klein, & Loper](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596516499.do) - Seems like an important thing for any aspiring data scientist to know about and practice.

* [Mathematics for Computer Science - MIT OCW](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/index.htm) - Mostly to learn about proofs and some basic graph and probability stuff.

* [Introduction To Algorithms; A Creative Approach - Udi Manber](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-A-Creative-Approach/dp/0201120372) - Maybe I should read a more traditional algorithms book, but the reviews of this book on amazon suggest that this book is great for teaching you how to "think" in algorithms, rather than just memorize them.




## Books/Courses/Units of Study that I have completed

* Arduino Projects.  I've done a handful of these over the past few years, but mostly learned from online tutorials and short, basically crappy books.  This is how I first got interested in programming and where I first learned the basics, so I have to include this paragraph here.

* [Javascript for Web Developers - Nicholas Zakas](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781118026694.do).  This was a hefty tome that I read on recommendation of [JavaScript.isSexy](http://javascriptissexy.com/).  Pretty boring, IMO, but very thorough.  Probably wouldn't recommend.

* [Eloquent Javascript - Marjin Haverbeke](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) - this is not only a great javascript resource, but a great introduction to web development and computer science--covering everything from functional and object oriented programming to node.js.  This book included some *super* interesting example projects like a compiler/interpreter implemented in Javascript and a whole bunch of cools Cellular Automata stuff.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone teaching him/herself programming.

* [MIT OCW introduction to Programming and Computer Science](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-fall-2008/) - This was my introduction to python and computer science.  I loved this class.  It covered tons of alogithms and data structures in python in a charming, engaging and informative way.

* [Think Stats - Allen Downey](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/) - Introduction to statistics and probability taught in python.  This book is incredible.  You will learn to build statistical models from scratch, and you will learn the "pandas" library, which is critical for anyone doing any kind of data munging in python.

* [Think Bayes - Allen Downey](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkbayes/thinkbayes.pdf) - Similar to Think Stats, except with more advanced methods of modeling and a deeper consideration of bayesian statistics.  This is also a terrific book, available for free and taught using python.

* [Think Complexity - Allen Downey](http://greenteapress.com/complexity/index.html) - Also taught in python, this book is a survey of topics in "complexity science", which includes graph algorithms, study of long-tail distributions, algorithmic complexity analysis, and automata.  Extremely interesting, but probably not critical.

* [Harvard CS109 - Data Science](http://cs109.github.io/2015/) - Wide ranging introduction to all topics computer science, from distributions to regression to machine learning to map reduce.  I did the course from 2014.  The teachers were really engaging and interesting.  I highly recommend this course.

* [Building Machine Learning Systems With Python - Richert Coelho](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/building-machine-learning-systems-python) - This is a really good book for learning scikit learn and some basic machine learning.  Not very in depth, but the code examples were helpful and interesting, and ultimately I got a lot out of this book.

* [Social Network Analysis For Startups - Tsvetovat and Kouznetsov](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920020424.do) - Pretty informative, interesting book by some pretty funny, cool sounding guys.  This book was not very "deep," but it was short and well-worth a read.

* [Coding the Matrix; Linear Algebra for Computer Scientists - Philip Klein](https://www.coursera.org/course/matrix) - Taught in Python.  This was a pretty interesting, difficult course, and I think I learned the basics of linear algebra pretty well from it, but to be honest I'm not sure.  I can multiply matrices like a baller, and I have some idea of how linear equations are solved.  Would recommend, also, for the practice that you get with list/dict comprehension etc, but I'm also not convinced that learning linear algebra the traditional way isn't better.

* [Machine Learning - Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) - This is an excellent course.  If you know some linear algebra (i.e. have taken *Coding the Matrix*), and you want to learn how machine learning algorithms work, you should absolutely take this course.  The teacher is generous and talented, and you will walk away a much better self-taught data scientist.

* [Flask Web Development - Miguel Grinberg](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920031116.do?cmp=af-webplatform-books-videos-product_cj_9781449372620_%25zp) - This is a terrific book for learning flask.  You go through building an entire flask app from hello-world to production.  The book is relatively interesting and highly complete.  It serves as a one-stop manual for practical flask web dev, and I highly recommend reading it if your are a self-taught data scientist looking to make an interface to some of your data.  As a bonus, you will learn SQL Alchemy from this book, which is critical and awesome for any aspiring data scientist.

* [CS100.1x Introduction to Big Data With Apache Spark - BerkeleyX](https://courses.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/CS100.1x/1T2015/info) - Introduction to big data analysis with Apache Spark. Excellent course for learning the basics of distributed programming with spark.  Highly recommend.

* [Web Scraping with Python - Ryan Mitchell](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034391.do) - Survey of scraping techniques in python.  Well worth a read if you are looking to collect data from the web.  This book is packed with useful hacks and tools.
