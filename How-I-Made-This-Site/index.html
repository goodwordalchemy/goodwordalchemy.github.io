    <h1>How I made this Site (Github Pages and Flask Static Sites) - <small>2015-10-30 12:00:00</small></h1>

</div>
<p>I tried using Jekyll before, but Jekyll is written in Ruby, so it was hard for me to customize or even hack with not knowing Ruby.  So that's why I made this static blog generator using Flask.  </p>
<p>I just finished reading the book <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/flask-web-development/9781491947586/">Flask Web Development</a> by Miguel Grinberg, which is a really amazing resource just just for learning flask but for learning web development in general.  </p>
<p>Basically, armed with the knowledge I gained through building the example social blogging app that they build in that book, I refactored the code described and linked to in <a href="http://stevenloria.com/hosting-static-flask-sites-for-free-on-github-pages/">this tutorial</a> by Steven Loria, where he  goes through how to configure Flask-Frozen and Flask-Flat-Pages for use on a github pages site.</p>
<p>That's pretty much it.  Then I followed the directions on the <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages site</a></p>
<p>Actually, that's not quite it.  I started using the site and I realized that it was kindof annoying to make the new files every time, and to go through the whole freeze.py and git workflow every time I wanted to add or edit an article, so I added a bunch of convenience commands using <a href="https://flask-script.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Flask-script</a>.  Check out the readme for <a href="https://github.com/goodwordalchemy/flask-jekyll">Flask-jekyll</a> for more info.</p>
